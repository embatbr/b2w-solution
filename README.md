# B2W Challenge - Solution

*This repository contains the solution for the B2W hiring challenge for Data Engineer. The challenge is describe in the file **challenge.pdf**.*


## Development

This solution was written using a computer with Ubuntu operating system, processor core-i3 and memory of 4G DDR4.

### Requirements:

- Java 8
- Maven


## Execution

Execute bash script *run.sh*.

*Since my default java version is 11 and Apache Beam requests 8, I had to specify the correct path for **JAVA_HOME**. In case your environment comes with Java 8 by default, comment the correspondent line in file run.sh. If you need to specify a different path for JAVA_HOME, change the correspondent line in file run.sh.*
